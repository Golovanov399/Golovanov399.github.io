<p>
Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.<br>
Nim Square is just like ordinary three-heap normal play Nim, but the players may only remove a square number of stones from a heap.<br/>
The number of stones in the three heaps is represented by the ordered triple (a,b,c).<br/>
If 0≤a≤b≤c≤29 then the number of losing positions for the next player is 1160.
</br></p>
<p>
Find the number of losing positions for the next player if 0≤a≤b≤c≤100 000.
