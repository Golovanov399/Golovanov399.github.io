<p>Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.
The area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.<br>
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.<br/>
Also c is a perfect square.</br></p>
<p>We will call a right angled triangle perfect if<br/>
-it is a primitive right angled triangle<br/>
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square</p>
<p>We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if<br/>
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and<br/>
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.
</p>
<p>How many perfect right-angled triangles with câ‰¤10<sup>16</sup> exist that are not super-perfect?</p>
