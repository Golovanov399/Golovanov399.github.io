<div class="problem_content">

<p>The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: 6<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> + 10<sup>2</sup> + 11<sup>2</sup> + 12<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1 = 0<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the numbers less than 10<sup>8</sup> that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.</p>
