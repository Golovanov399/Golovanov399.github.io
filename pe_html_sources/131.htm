<div class="problem_content">

<p>There are some prime values, <i>p</i>, for which there exists a positive integer, <i>n</i>, such that the expression <i>n</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>n</i><sup>2</sup><i>p</i> is a perfect cube.</p>
<p>For example, when <i>p</i> = 19, 8<sup>3</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup>Ã—19 = 12<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of <i>n</i> is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.</p>
<p>How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?</p>
