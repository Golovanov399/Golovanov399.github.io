<p>The flipping game is a two player game played on a N by N square board.<br>
Each square contains a disk with one side white and one side black.<br/>
The game starts with all disks showing their white side.</br></p>
<p>A turn consists of flipping all disks in a rectangle with the following properties:
</p><p></p><ul><li>the upper right corner of the rectangle contains a white disk</li>
<li>the rectangle width is a perfect square (1, 4, 9, 16, ...)</li>

W(1) = 1, W(2) = 0, W(5) = 8 and W(10<sup>2</sup>) = 31395.</p>
<p>For N=5, the first player's eight winning first moves are:</p>
