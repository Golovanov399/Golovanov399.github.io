<div class="problem_content">

<p>In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var> are positive integers.</p>
<p>$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$</p>
<p>It can be verified that when $n = 1260$ there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of $n$ for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.</p>
<p>What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?</p>
<p class="smaller">NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of <a href="problem=108">Problem 108</a> and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.</p>
