Consider a rectangle made up of $W \times H$ square cells each with area 1.<br> Each cell is independently coloured black with probability 0.5 otherwise white. Black cells sharing an edge are assumed to be connected.<br/>Consider the maximum area of connected cells.</br></p>
<p>
Define $E(W,H)$ to be the expected value of this maximum area.
For example, $E(2,2)=1.875$, as illustrated below.
