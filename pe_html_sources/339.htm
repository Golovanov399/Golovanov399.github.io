<i>"And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the borders of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level meadows. And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep, and on the other a flock of black sheep. And whenever one of the white sheep bleated, one of the black sheep would cross over and become white; and when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep would cross over and become black."</i><br><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mabinogion/Peredur_the_Son_of_Evrawc">en.wikisource.org</a>
</br></p>
<p>

Initially each flock consists of <var>n</var> sheep. Each sheep (regardless of colour) is equally likely to be the next sheep to bleat. After a sheep has bleated and a sheep from the other flock has crossed over, Peredur may remove a number of white sheep in order to maximize the expected final number of black sheep. Let E(<var>n</var>) be the expected final number of black sheep if Peredur uses an optimal strategy.
