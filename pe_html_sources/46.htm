<p>It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.</p>
<p class="margin_left">9 = 7 + 2×1<sup>2</sup><br>
15 = 7 + 2×2<sup>2</sup><br/>
21 = 3 + 2×3<sup>2</sup><br/>
25 = 7 + 2×3<sup>2</sup><br/>
27 = 19 + 2×2<sup>2</sup><br/>
33 = 31 + 2×1<sup>2</sup></br></p>
<p>It turns out that the conjecture was false.</p>
<p>What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?</p>
