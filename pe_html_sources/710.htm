<h4>On Sunday 5 April 2020 the Project Euler membership first exceeded one million members. We would like to present this problem to celebrate that milestone. Thank you to everyone for being a part of Project Euler.</h4>
<p>The number 6 can be written as a palindromic sum in exactly eight different ways:</p>
$$(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (1, 4, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2), (3, 3), (6)$$

<p>We shall define a <dfn>twopal</dfn> to be a palindromic tuple having at least one element with a value of 2. It should also be noted that elements are not restricted to single digits. For example, $(3, 2, 13, 6, 13, 2, 3)$ is a valid twopal.</p>
<p>If we let $t(n)$ be the number of twopals whose elements sum to $n$, then it can be seen that $t(6) = 4$:</p>
$$(1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2)$$

<p>Similarly, $t(20) = 824$.</p>
<p>In searching for the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, it can be verified that $t(42) = 1999923$, which happens to be the first value of $t(n)$ that exceeds one million.</p>
<p>However, your challenge to the "ultimatest" question of life, the universe, and everything is to find the least value of $n \gt 42$ such that $t(n)$ is divisible by one million.</p>
